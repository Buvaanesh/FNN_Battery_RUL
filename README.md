The Feedforward Neural Network algorithm for the prediction of Remaiining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries. 

The FNN.py file has 1 input layer, 5 hidden layers and 1 output layer. 

The model uses linear regression to understand the dataset which consists of CV-CC charging cycle battery data with actual RUL.
